    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      WeighSaver was created to fight fraud and tampering in weighing machines.  
      Our goal is to ensure fair trade by making sure that customers always know the **true weight**.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      Each device is assigned a **unique Device ID** that stores its history, performance logs, and tampering alerts.  
      This helps businesses stay transparent and build trust with their customers.
